## How it started
##
- Fell in love with Linux and C++ circa 2008-2009
- First real Linux job was as a Linux administrator
- Then a support engineer at Red Hat
- Moved to engineering; wrote Python 
- Wanted to work on OpenStack, but got a project on containers

## My introduction to Go
##
- Docker arrived with a bang - it was written in Go
- Kubernetes arrived next - again a Go project
- Ecosystem developed around k8s and most (all?) projects were in Go - FOMO
- Opportunity to work on [odo](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo) (a Go CLI)

## Working with Go
## 
- Confused while switching from Python to Go; took a while
- At one point, not long ago, decided to [plunge into Go](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adharmit+is%3Aclosed)
- Got to work on:
    - concurrency primitives
        - fun but easy to do it wrong
    - Kubernetes Operator pattern
        - just reading its code is ðŸ¤¯
    - `context` package
    - interfaces are great, but took me time
    - [KubeVirt](https://github.com/kubevirt) project
- Trying to do k8s upstream contribution ðŸ¤ž
